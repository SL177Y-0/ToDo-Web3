# ✅ Decentralized Task Management dApp 

The **Decentralized Task Management dApp** is a blockchain-powered application designed to manage tasks transparently and securely. It integrates **smart contracts** for immutable task management and leverages **AI** to optimize task prioritization.  

---

## 🚀 Project Overview  

This project consists of three core components:  

### 🔹 **Smart Contract (`/contract`)**  
- Implements task management logic on the blockchain.  
- Ensures decentralized and tamper-proof task tracking.  

### 🔹 **Backend Server (`/backend`)**  
- Built with **NestJS** for handling authentication and API interactions.  
- Uses **MistralAI7b AI** for intelligent task prioritization.  

### 🔹 **Frontend (`/frontend`)**  
- Provides an intuitive **React-based UI** with **wallet authentication**.  
- Integrates **MetaMask** for secure blockchain interaction.
